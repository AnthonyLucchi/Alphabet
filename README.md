# Alphabet
Teaches the alphabet in a timed app

The purpose of this app is to time a users reaction in picking out letters in alphabetical order.
On starting the app a display with letters appears and a timer will begin. 
As the user clicks on the letters the correct ones will appear at the bottom of the page. 
If the wrong letter is chosen then the letters will rearrange.

Upon choosing the last letter the score is displayed and the game ends.
